Module      : LiveCoding.Migrate.NoMigration
Description : Mechanism to save state in a Cell without requiring a Data instance.

If a data type is wrapped in 'NoMigration' then it can be used as the state of a 'Cell'
without requiring it to have a 'Data' instance. The consequence is that if the type has changed
in between a livereload, then the previous saved value will be discarded, and no migration attempt
will happen.

'LiveCoding' does not export 'delay' and 'changes' from this module. These functions should be
used with a qualified import.

{- | Caching version of 'arrM'.

   Only runs the computation in @m@ when the input value
   changes. Meanwhile it keeps outputing the last outputted value. Also runs the computation
   on the first tick. Does not require 'Data' instance. On `:livereload` will run action again on
   first tick.
